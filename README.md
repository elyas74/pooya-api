# pooya API

this is a sample nodejs API, but u can write it in any language, main site uses anular and speaks to server in JOSN base requests and any one with cookie can send request to server and get the data, just like the brower.

u can see examples in [example](https://github.com/elyas74/pooya-api/tree/master/v0/node/example) folder. 

this API will be complete soon

if u write api for other languages please send it with pull request.
